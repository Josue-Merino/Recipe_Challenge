## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm still learning the basic concepts of CSS and HTML, this project helped me to learn concepts like flexbox, colors, paragraphs, headings, etc. Talking about HTML, I learned concepts like the structure of HTML documents and their tags.
Also I worked with "ResposivelyApp" and the browser console, whose helped me to verify the mobile and desktop design.
